# Unstuck-Duck

**Abstract**
One of the most effective ways to learn is to teach (Muis). We decided to leverage the use of generative AI to turn any learner into a teacher. With Unstuck Duck, teach your student, who happens to be a sentient rubber duck, any concept you want. It will respond with follow-up questions, where your explanations might be unclear, and challenge oversimplifications. Instead of providing answers directly, Unstuck Duck evaluates how well the concept was taught and offers a teaching score that reflects how a student would perform based solely on the user’s explanation. The more you teach your rubber duck, the more you learn and master your topic. By shifting generative AI from answer generation to guided teaching and feedback, Unstuck Duck helps users build deeper understanding and long-term mastery.


**Our Solution**
We strive to turn indirect learning into direct teaching. Users will teach their topic to a rubber duck that behaves like a curious student. Based on the user’s explanation, the duck asks clarifying questions, asks for examples, and points out inconsistencies. Creating a pseudo teaching experience will encourage deep learning, instead of surface level knowledge.
At any point the user can request a “teaching score”. The score represents what the duck would have gotten if it were to take a test solely using the information the user provided. This feedback helps users identify weak points and refine their explanations.
Another feature we plan to implement is a synchronous study session within the product using Zoom API. This will allow learners to coordinate their newfound built knowledge at their own convenience.
By encouraging the user to explain concepts clearly and respond to questions, Unstuck Duck creates not only understanding, but mastery of a topic.
