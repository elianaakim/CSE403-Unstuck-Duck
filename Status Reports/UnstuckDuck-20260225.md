**Weekly Report**

**High Level Goal**: Fix any major bugs, and refine features to ensure a smooth end-to=end user flow

**Original Goals for the Week**: 
* Improve prompt quality and scoring accuracy(switching to Gemini)
* Finish Zoom integration
* Finish User athentication(supabase)
* Finish Speech-to-text
* More graphics 
* Improve accesability

**Progress and Issues**: We decided to stick with Ollama since testing with Gemini would get pricey. We were able to add the basic forms of all our main features (Zoom study rooms, history page, user authentication, and speech-to-text) and we plan to fix any bugs in the upcoming weeks.

**Questions for the Product Owner**: Screen recording our speech to text feature doesnt pick up the audio, is it fine to record with our phones?
**Goals for Next Week**: 
* Finish CI and Code Coverage - 1 week - Yang mostly
* Polish Zoom - Ava, Eli
* Polish Speech-to-text - 4 days - Mia
* Refine UI/UX - Mia, Wesley, Yang
* Refine user accounts - Iris
