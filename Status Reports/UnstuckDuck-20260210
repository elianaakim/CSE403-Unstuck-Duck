**Weekly Report**

**High Level Goal**:  Create an internal MVP by finishing core teaching UI and core teaching logic

**Original Goals for the Week**: 
* Implement Teaching Session UI
* Implement main menu UI
* Integrate OpenAI API
* Implement Teaching Score Logic
* Approving merge requests and reading over changes for APIs/Evaluation logic
* Connect frontend inputs to backend responses
* Test and identify issues
* Make assets 

**Progress and Issues**: Simple UI is all setup (will do final polish near the end). Set up CI. More things for backend to do compared to frontend. Still figuring out art style. Might switch to ollama instead.

**Questions for the Product Owner**: What features should we have for beta? What features should wait? Better to work on beta demo then other features, or both in parallel?
