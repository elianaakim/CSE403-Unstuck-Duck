**Weekly Report**

**High Level Goal**:  Describe in one line the overarching goal of your next release, which may take multiple weeks to achieve.

**Original Goals for the Week**: This section should be an exact copy of the last section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago).

**Progress and Issues**: Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are blocked.

**Questions for the Product Owner**: Any questions for the TA for Thursday project meetings.

**Goals for Next Week**:  Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate (no longer than a week). We recommend that you label these with the student(s) who is responsible for the item.
