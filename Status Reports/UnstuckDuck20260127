**Weekly Report**

**High Level Goal**: Our overarching goal is to integrate OpenAI, calculate teaching score for the duck to display, host on the web, and generate an image visualization feature.  

**Original Goals for the Week**: The original goals for this week include setting up the repository, finalizing the MVP scope, starting UX and Figma design, determining teaching score logic, and determining data schema. 

**Progress and Issues**: Report on progress and issues: We made a shared repository, assigned each person which sub goal to finish by next week, and finalized the MVP scope. We are planning to start the UX design using Figma design, determine the teaching score logic, and determine the data schema by this Friday.
Currently not really blocked on anything. 

**Questions for the Product Owner**: We are wondering which AI tool would be the cheapest and still well-functioned. Do you recommend DeepSeek, OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Llama etc?
