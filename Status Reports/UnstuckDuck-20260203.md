**Weekly Report**

**High Level Goal**:  For sprint 0, we finalized our structure of our project and how we are going to implement it.

**Original Goals for the Week**: 
Start Figma UI/UX 
Initialize React frontend
Define duck behavior
Research OpenAI usage and limits
Define teaching score
Define API contracts between front and back

**Progress and Issues**: We finished all the basic Figma screens we need. We initialized the react frontend. Defined the duck behavior. We reasearched OpenAI API usage. Defined teachinging score. Figured out API contracts between front and back. We had trouble getting used to git.

**Questions for the Product Owner**: How to be make sure we are going to finish our project and not take on too many features? Can we have more than P2? Recommendation for APIs that arent too expensive
