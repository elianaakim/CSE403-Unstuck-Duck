**Weekly Report**

**High Level Goal**: Integrate an AI model, compute and display a teaching score for the duck, deploy the application on the web, and support an image visualization feature.

**Original Goals for the Week**: 
* Set up the repository
* Finalize the MVP scope
* Start UX and Figma design
* Determine teaching score logic
* Determine data schema

**Progress and Issues**: 
* Created a shared GitHub repository and ensured all team members had access.
* Finalized the MVP scope and clarified what features are required for the first release.
* Assigned sub-goals to each team member with clear ownership for the upcoming week.
* Discussed initial ideas for teaching score logic and data schema.
* Learned more about how to split frontend and backend responsibilities early to avoid integration issues later.
* No major blockers at the moment.
* UX design, teaching score logic, and data schema definition are still in progress and planned to be completed by Friday.

**Questions for the Product Owner**: 
* Which AI model or platform would you recommend that balances low cost with reliable performance?
* Between options like OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, Claude, or Llama, is there one you prefer for this project?
